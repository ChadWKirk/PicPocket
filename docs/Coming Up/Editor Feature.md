# Editor Feature

This is planning for a new way to edit image information.

The goal of this feature is to provide a more intuitive way for users to edit their image information on mobile and desktop. There will also be a way for users to edit their images in some capacity by using the Cloudinary Editor widget.

## Edit In Image Modal:

When user clicks on image in image gallery that is theirs, there is an edit (grey pencil) and delete (red background white trash can) button in the modal top bar.

When user clicks edit in modal, they get redirected to Modal_imageSelectEditable which is the same modal but the divs are inputs with same styling to make it look like user is editing the actual page.

In modal editable, there will be a “pic workshop” button that brings user to different page with Cloudinary Image editor widget where they can crop, etc.

## Edit in My Pics:

In My Pics on mobile, there will be a grey pencil icon at the right side end of image title which will show modal editable.
