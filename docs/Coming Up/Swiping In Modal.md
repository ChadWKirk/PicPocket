# Swiping In Mobile Modal

I will make it so that the users can use swipe while on mobile to go through images rather than clicking the arrows in imageSelectModal.

This will be an option, not a replacement.

I think I will make it so that the arrows kind of pulse brightly a couple times on first modal open just to make them more obvious to the user so they can see them, since by design they are pretty much invisible in order to not obstruct the view of the image.
