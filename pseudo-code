to check if user is signed in: for each user, have a signedIn: true/false when
submitted in /SignIn page, check for if name = req.body.name && password =
req.body.password. If both true, change signedIn to true. To sign out, when
click Sign Out button, search for any document with signedIn: true and then
change it to false and then go back to home page as if user is signed out.
