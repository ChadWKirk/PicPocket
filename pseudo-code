make it so that when you sign up, that account is now the only account signed in.
If find another user with signedIn: true, give message that says "This will sign you out of your account, curUser. Are you sure you want to continue signing up as newUser.username?". If yes, set curUser.signedIn to false. If cancel, just don't do anything:

- find a way to get array of people already signed in

show signed in as:

- Fix signed in as: render time

Sign In Page:

- take away sign in button when already signed in (going to be passing in props or conditional rendering)

account page:

- details like cc info and shipping address
- add item listing to sell (need to make store page first)

make it so navbar changes based on if user is signed in

DelSuccess:

when delete account, navigate to main page with "Account permanentely removed." banner. Banner disappears on refresh or when going to a different page.
