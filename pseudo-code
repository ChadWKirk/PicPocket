So far, CRUD works.

Sign up:

- signing up as new user works
- sometimes sign up confirm box doesn't sign users out
- sometimes after confirm box, account page is blank

server:

- fix "can not read collection" error that you get sometimes when server loads. Something with database not being ready yet.

account page:

- details like cc info and shipping address
- add item listing to sell (need to make store page first)
