How to manage images:

- host images on Cloudinary and use their API to fetch them
- put watermark and scale them to bad resolution on site until download (can do with Cloudinary I think)

Upload Images:

- Going to allow users to upload images to the website
- When user is uploading, Force them to categorize it into one or more hardcoded categories (Dogs, Cats, Trucks, etc.). Have a tree of categories, meaning if a pic is categorized as "Truck" it is also categorized under Automotive.

Home Page:

- after banner, have a section explaining what the website is
- after that, have section explaining how to upload your own images
- after that, have section explaining how to get paid for uploading
- after that, have sign up call to action
- after that, footer

Styling:

- make search bar form flex/centered again
- need to create catalog section styling. Have flex and each flex item have random width between minwidth: 120px and max-width: 245px;. return each gallery item with a for loop or something.
- need logo done

Catalog section:

- when clicking on a category or searching for an image, make a route that goes /search/whateverTheySearchedFor that makes a fetch request to the MongoDB database to get those images
- allow user to rate images
- allow user to like an image which sends it to their likes section that they can go back to
- allow to sort by new, old, price, rating high-low or ratings low-high

Image-View Page:

- need to make page user goes to when clicking on a picture
- will have like button, ratings button, price, rating, tags, add to cart button and buy now button
- Will have related images section under that main section detailed above
- When clicking a tag, it will go to /search/thatTag and pull up all images with that tag or word in title

Cart Page:

-
