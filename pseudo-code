Delete User:

delete not getting username from url due to curUser not updating in time on render. Need to make it so curUser doesn't get assigned until it is not undefined.

server:

- fix "can not read collection" error that you get sometimes when server loads. Something with database not being ready yet.

show signed in as:

- Fix signed in as: render time (it is because it is 'undefined' until about third render in app.js)

account page:

- details like cc info and shipping address
- add item listing to sell (need to make store page first)
