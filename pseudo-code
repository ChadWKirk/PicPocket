Concepts to brush up on:

React state (when it visibly updates, how to increment state using previous state)
CSS (flexbox, position, display)
JSON parsing (JSON.parse(), JSON.stringify(), response.json())
How to handle individual components in an array (ToDo tutorial)

Image Selection (My Pics, My Likes):

- When single select, show edit stuff in form.
- Can mass delete and/or mass download.
- to handle form contents:

on checkbox click, if indexof object data is >= 0 (or .includes(object data) filter from array. if indexof <0 (-1) (or .!includes(object data), push object with info to an array.

On label click, reset array and then push label's info to array.

If massArr.current.length == 1, show that images info and preview and set submit/delete to that image

If array.length > 1, show stack of little images and say "Select a single image to edit it here"

- Keep array of what is selected in order to mass delete/download
- Have buttons that appear for delete/download when at least one image is selected

How to manage images:

- host images on Cloudinary, fetch them from their API, store in MongoDB on upload so you can add likes and author.
- Can turn PNG or other lossless formats into jpg by just changing the extension on the url. get lastIndexOf "." in the URL and replace everything after it with "jpg". Use cloudinary scale terms and q_x term in url to scale down image dimensions and quality to further optimize them. https://cloudinary.com/documentation/image_optimization#how_to_optimize_image_sizing. search slice in mypics page for code. https://cloudinary.com/documentation/image_optimization. for upload page, need to wait until it is uploaded and secure url is generated before slicing.

SIGNED OUT BEHAVIOR:

    - need to make it so that when liking a pic if signed out, don't increase likes
    and don't add "undefined" to likedBy. And take to sign up page
    that also has a sign in link "Already a member? Sign In"

Search:

- make it so plural form gets searched when searching for something and vice versa. Example searching for "Cats" brings up "Cat" and vice versa

Upload Images:

- deal with image view page going to proper URL and using the given title and description etc.

- don't allow anything but numbers, letters (both cases), spaces, undercores, dashes and apostrophes on edit in title - turn title box red and have text in red by Title label "(Do Not Use Special Characters.)". If try to submit with special characters in title, show alert saying "Remove Special Characters From Title" and don't submit. - run a function in onChange of title input field that checks if anything other than allowed chars are in title and changes input css accordingly. - have if statement in submit function to check if title has special chars to run post request or show alert.

My Pics page:

- DEAL WITH EDIT SUCCESS/FAILURE
- under title, have gallery to show pics. have ability to sort pics just like in a search page
- have the ability to check off pictures for mass delete

Likes page:

- show liked pictures in a gallery like search page
- able to sort like search page
- able to search through liked images with little search bar to the right. automatically updates them without changing url
- able to check off multiple ones and click remove from likes with are you sure box
- able to click three dots icon on individual images and hit remove from likes with are you sure box

Image-View Page:

- need to make page user goes to when clicking on a picture
- will have title, like button, description, price, tags, add to cart button, buy now button and free download button
- Will have related images section under that main section detailed above
- When clicking a tag, it will go to /search/thatTag and pull up all images with that tag or word in title

Overlay tip - use pointer-events: none; on after pseudo element to make it click through so you can click the image and right click save as the image.

Sign up:

- signing up as new user works
- sometimes sign up confirm box doesn't sign users out
- sometimes after confirm box, account page is blank

- send authentication email

server:

- fix "can not read collection" error that you get sometimes when server loads. Something with database not being ready yet.

misc:

- need to hash passwords
