Delete User:

need to make it so that when navigating back to main page after deleting account,
make del = 1 until next rerender. pass del to main page and navbar to conditionally render acc removed banner and sign in/up buttons. Maybe can use dependancy array with useEffect.

Sign up:

- need to make sign up sign in the new user and navigate to success page when user is new (no confirm box)

server:

- fix "can not read collection" error that you get sometimes when server loads. Something with database not being ready yet.

account page:

- details like cc info and shipping address
- add item listing to sell (need to make store page first)

Sign Out:

- might want to change findOne to just find to find all signed in users instead of just the first one it finds
