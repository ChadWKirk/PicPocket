- need to change Signed In As: to something more sleek to show who user is signed in as

Catalog section:

- when clicking on a category or searching for an image, make a route that goes /search/whateverTheySearchedFor that makes a fetch request to the MongoDB database to get those images
- allow user to rate images
- allow user to like an image which sends it to their likes section that they can go back to
- allow to sort by new, old, price, rating high-low or ratings low-high
