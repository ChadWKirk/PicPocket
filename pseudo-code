make it so that when you sign up, that account is now the only account signed in.

show signed in as:

- Fix SignInPage.js curUser to show signed in as: before sign in attempt.

Sign In Page:

- take away sign in button when already signed in (going to be passing in props or conditional rendering)
- make it so that when navigating to main page after sign in, shows user signed in as

account page:

- details like cc info and shipping address
- add item listing to sell (need to make store page first)

make it so navbar changes based on if user is signed in

when at /delSuccess, make it so when it gets refreshed it navigates to regular home page.
