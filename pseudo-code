Delete User:

delete confirm not changing del value to bring up delete banner due to useState not updating immediately. Need to do something in MainPage useEffect to check for it or something.

server:

- fix "can not read collection" error that you get sometimes when server loads. Something with database not being ready yet.

account page:

- details like cc info and shipping address
- add item listing to sell (need to make store page first)

Sign Out:

- might want to change findOne to just find to find all signed in users instead of just the first one it finds
