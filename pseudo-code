make it so that when you sign up, that account is now the only account signed in.

Sign In Page:

- make it not navigate when incorrect sign in
- give an error for when trying to sign in with account you're already signed in as
- take away sign in button when already signed in

account page:

- details like cc info and shipping address
- add item listing to sell (need to make store page first)

make it so navbar changes based on if user is signed in

when at /delSuccess, make it so when it gets refreshed it navigates to regular home page.
