How to manage images:

- host images on Cloudinary and use their API to fetch them
- put watermark and scale them to bad resolution on site until download (can do with Cloudinary I think)
- need to figure out how to get json array out of fetch for carousel

Home Page:

- Have slideshow banner with random images (5)
- after banner, have random images titled "Images to get you started"

Styling:

- need to create catalog section styling
- need logo done

Catalog section:

- search bar goes to /search/whateverTheySearchFor. The search will pull up any image that has a corresponding tage or has that word in the title
- when clicking on a category or searching for an image, make a route that goes /search/whateverTheySearchedFor that makes a fetch request to the MongoDB database to get those images
- allow user to rate images
- allow user to like an image which sends it to their likes section that they can go back to
- allow to sort by new, old, price, rating high-low or ratings low-high

Image-View Page:

- need to make page user goes to when clicking on a picture
- will have like button, ratings button, price, rating, tags, add to cart button and buy now button
- When clicking a tag, it will go to /search/thatTag and pull up all images with that tag or word in title

Cart Page:

-

Sign up:

- signing up as new user works
- sometimes sign up confirm box doesn't sign users out
- sometimes after confirm box, account page is blank

server:

- fix "can not read collection" error that you get sometimes when server loads. Something with database not being ready yet.

account page:

- details like cc info and shipping address (database)

Payment:

- need to add paypal and stripe

misc:

- need to hash passwords
- need to figure out how to securely store payment info
