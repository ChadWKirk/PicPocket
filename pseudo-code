Make the sign up are you sure box actually update the signed in users to false rather than assigning the values

show signed in as:

- Fix signed in as: render time

Sign In Page:

- take away sign in button when already signed in (going to be passing in props or conditional rendering)

account page:

- details like cc info and shipping address
- add item listing to sell (need to make store page first)

make it so navbar changes based on if user is signed in

DelSuccess:

when delete account, navigate to main page with "Account permanentely removed." banner. Banner disappears on refresh or when going to a different page.
