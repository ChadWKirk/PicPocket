How to manage images:

- host images on Cloudinary, fetch them from their API, store in MongoDB on upload so you can add likes and author.
- put watermark and scale them to bad resolution on site until download (can do with Cloudinary I think)

Upload Images:

- when submitting upload, replace that individual upload form with a green check mark icon, indicating upload complete
- if upload failed, idk what to do GUI wise yet.
- make it so can't upload without title given
- deal with image view page going to proper URL and using the given title and description etc.

My Pics page:

- Have a title like "My Pics"
- under title, have gallery to show pics. have ability to sort pics just like in a search page
- have the ability to check off pictures for mass delete
- have upload button that brings up cloudinary upload widget
- when clicking on a picture, it pops up in a widget where you can change the title, tags, description, and price. you can also delete from this page. It doesn't change the page it just pops up in front of everything like a widget.

Likes page:

- show liked pictures in a gallery like search page
- able to sort like search page
- able to search through liked images with little search bar to the right. automatically updates them without changing url
- able to check off multiple ones and click remove from likes with are you sure box
- able to click three dots icon on individual images and hit remove from likes with are you sure box

Home Page:

- after banner, have a section explaining what the website is
- after that, have section explaining how to upload your own images
- after that, have section explaining how to get paid for uploading
- after that, have sign up call to action
- after that, footer

Styling:

- make search bar form flex/centered again
- gallery styling: have a total width to take up and have 3 images have a combined width of that total. must maintain aspect ratio. min width of each image about 200px.
- need logo done

Catalog section:

- when clicking on a category or searching for an image, make a route that goes /search/whateverTheySearchedFor that makes a fetch request to the MongoDB database to get those images
- allow user to like an image which sends it to their likes section that they can go back to
- allow to sort by new, old, price, popular (amount of likes from most to least)
- allow to filter by either photo or illustration

Image-View Page:

- need to make page user goes to when clicking on a picture
- will have title, like button, description, price, tags, add to cart button, buy now button and free download button
- Will have related images section under that main section detailed above
- When clicking a tag, it will go to /search/thatTag and pull up all images with that tag or word in title
